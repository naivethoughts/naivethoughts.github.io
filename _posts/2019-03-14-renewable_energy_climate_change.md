Over the centuries per capita energy consumption has been synonymous with human welfare and progress. As the energy spent is an indicator of progress in  infrastructure, military, science & technology and health care which are essential for a socially and politically stable state. However the progress in technology coupled with advancement in healthcare has increased the life expectancy, which has furthered our reliance on conventional energy sources to sustain an ever increasing population. The extraction and use of the conventional sources such as fossil fuels apart from being a source of geo-political tensions have also contributed to the changes in climate.

The 20<sup>th</sup> century witnessed rapid industrialization and urbanization has led to an increased dependence on the carbon based fuels. 2795 GT of carbon based fuel reserve is available for our use over the next 20-30 years based on the current estimate of the growth, however according to our current international accord of limiting the average global temperature rise to 2<sup>o</sup>C we can only 'safely' emit 565 GT of CO<sub>2</sub>, thus only 20% of the reserve is usable without 'drastic climate events'. Though the temperature rise of 2<sup>o</sup>C appear to be minute, the average rise in the global temperature by 0.8<sup>o</sup>C has been marked by increased periods of droughts in the tropical regions, increased frequency of cyclones such as Sandy and  Haiyan. Eventhough we have not been able to reach a political consensus on the climate change, partly due to the alternative facts and the influence of traditional fuel industries in protecting their interests, a definite trend can be observed from the nature.

January 2016, marked the consecutive 374<sup>th</sup> month with monthly average temperature greater than the average temperature of the last century, the probability of such an event is of the order of 1 in 10<sup>100</sup>. This is corroborated by the fact that we have seen an increased share of hotter days in the past two decades than the average temperature of the last century, a direct effect of which can be observed in the decreasing area of the arctic sea ice  and the increasing average winter temperature, which is measured to be 9<sup>o</sup>C greater than the average temperatures during the Northern hemisphere winter. The melting of this land ice would cause an increase in the sea level, and an increased sea level has already affected cities such as Miami - characterized by 'sunny day floods' during high tides. A secondary effect has been the increased moisture in the atmosphere leading to an increased frequency of flash floods in the US (Texas, Arizona), Chile, Spain, France etc in the last 5 years. A tertiary effect has been the increase in the frequency of forest fires in the Western US and in Australia. Another key indicator has been the migration of the tropical plants, animals, fishes to the conducive 'changed' conditions of the Northern latitudes.

Apart from these disastrous effects on the environment, the future of the economy appears to be bleak to an extent that the World Economy Survey cites "Climate Change" as the #1 threat to the future economy. Apart from the threat of rising sea levels, the mega-cities such as New York, Shanghai and Mumbai are perceived to have major outbreaks of equatorial microbial diseases due to the favourable increased temperatures in mid latitudes. The current estimate of the deaths due to various climate change events are around 400,000 apart from the destruction of land and property which has already affected the insurance companies. Since the early 1990s, the scientific community has realized the disastrous effects of a changing climate  and has been looking forward to mitigate these effects  without reducing the per capita energy consumption and we have been investing in the development of resources such as solar and wind power as an alternative.

In the recent climate summits, Copenhagen and Paris have bound the nations to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions in order to maintain the warming temperature well below 2<sup>o</sup>C. These agreements should drive the development and establishment of alternative fuels, which is estimated to cost around $790 bn in contrast to a $4500 bn fossil fuel industry, incidentally subsidized 40% more than the alternative fuel. In the current chaotic political scenario, though the future follow up on these agreements are uncertain, it is quite unfair to turn a blind eye on the progress in the renewable sector.

Currently US has 15% of the total power demand met by the renewable sector which can rise upto 80% by 2040. The major players in the sector include Germany, China, Spain, Sweden and the developing countries such as Costa Rica, Nicaruga, Morocco, Kenya have leapfrogged into the era of renewable energy. One of the key drivers has been the decreasing costs of the solar silicon cells, lithium ion batteries and a strong political leadership supporting their ambitious goals for renewable energy generation with investments.

A retrospection of our milestones in the renewable energy sector, acheiving way beyond our estimates, predicts a future not so bleak. Wind energy harvest has increased by 15x in 2015 from 30 GW in 2010. Similarly installed solar power is 58x more to the estimated 1 GW by 2015. In the year 2016, we have seen that China has doubled its solar power to 77.42 GW, the 90 % of newly commissioned power sources in Europe has been in the renewable sectors, reliance of US on natural gas and renewables due to the systematic shift from coal has resulted in the 25 year low in greenhouse gas emissions has renewed the hope of a low carbon future. A future, which would mark us as "the generation who cured the fever of the Earth".
