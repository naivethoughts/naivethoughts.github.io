# Lectures

# Week 1 :
### Lecture 1 : What is a neural network?
Predictions(y) by any model depends on several parameters(x1,x2..xn). A well trained
neural network model assigns a weight to each of the parameter, based on the available
training data. The weights, thus assigned, are used to make new predictions.
### Lecture 2 : Supervised Learning with a neural network
Data come across in the form of structured data (tables,matrices etc.) and unstructured
data(images, sounds etc.).
### Lecture 3 : Why is deep learning taking off?
* Data : Large sets of labeled data due to digitization of the economy.
* Computation : Leaps in computational power, enabling deeper networks and more hidden layers.
* Algorithms  : Faster turn around times, reducing the time-lag for iterative improvements.
