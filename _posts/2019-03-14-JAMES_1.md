## Key Points :
* A large eddy simulation with spectral bin cloud microphysics is scaled to
simulate a laboratory convection chamber.
* The simulated mixing state and turbulence properties reasonably compare with a
simple flux model and with measurements.
* The simulation replicates published observations from the Pi Chamber, including
steady-state clouds and size distribution broadening.
