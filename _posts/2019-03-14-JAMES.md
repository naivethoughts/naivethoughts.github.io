<!-- ## Key Points :
* A large eddy simulation with spectral bin cloud microphysics is scaled to
simulate a laboratory convection chamber.
* The simulated mixing state and turbulence properties reasonably compare with a
simple flux model and with measurements.
* The simulation replicates published observations from the Pi Chamber, including
steady-state clouds and size distribution broadening. -->

## Perspective :
"Can the controlled laboratory experiments be of any significance in the atmospheric context?", this publication is an answer to this particular question. Here we have selected a tool, a computational model called System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM), that has been successfully used to study various onsite observations and modified to study laboratory experiments. Furthermore, we have quantitatively compared the computational results with the laboratory experiments and in turn we reach a conclusion that the laboratory observations are of significance in the atmospheric context, hopefully we will be able to quantify the importance at some point in the future.

## Disclaimer :
Like every other study, this study is neither perfect nor complete, but this paper reflects the best of our understanding as of 02/22/2019.
