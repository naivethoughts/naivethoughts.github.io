## <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=2" target="_blank"> Problem 2 </a>
Fibonacci series starts with 0, 1 and the next number in the series is generated by summing the previous two numbers in the series as follows<br/>
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 . . . .<br/>

The objective is to sum all the even digits in the Fibonacci series, and from the series one can observe every 3rd digit is a even number. The reason being odd + even is odd and odd + odd is even.
$$ F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) $$ <br/>
is the general form of Fibonacci series, with a little bit of algebra one can find F(n) in terms of F(n-3) and F(n-6). Therefore, F(n), F(n-3) and F(n-6) are successive even digits in the Fibonacci series. Furthermore, calculating the odd numbers in the series and checking if the number is even is computationally expensive should one go for brute force approach.<br/>
\\(F(n) = 4 F(n-3) + F(n-6)\\)

```python
#!/bin/python3
import sys
t = int(input().strip())
for a0 in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    a6 = 0
    a3 = 2
    cSum = 0
    while(a3<=n) :
        cSum += a3
        a6,a3 = a3,4*a3 + a6
    print(cSum)
```
My first solution was brute force approach, on noticing the pattern, I adopted the reduced formula approach which is less resource intensive. Though, I do not approve of using formulae for solutions, this case proves to be an exception since the equation for even F(n) can be arrived using simple algebra and first principles of Fibonacci series.
