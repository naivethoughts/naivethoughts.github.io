Hi, I am Subin Thomas - a third year PhD student working on Large Eddy
Simulations of atmosphere at Michigan Technological University. This website
serves as a  repository for my opinions, codes and thoughts. I have broad
interests ranging  from existential nihilism to the climate change policy making
and hence will be posting on several topics.

## Motivation
{:notice}

Browsing through the internet, I came across the blog of Walter Hannah,
scientist at LLNL and in the blog, he provided a brief description of his
publications and his perspectives on different climate models etc. Further, an
insight into the mind of the author of a publication is valuable to the general
reader and I believe this blog can be a good platform for that.

Secondly, during the course of my PhD - I have realized, there are poorly
written tools popping up as the top Google search results for several problems
related to fluid dynamics or rather basic statistics. Hence, I had to struggle a
lot to differentiate between good and bad code. (*Someone might classify my code
to be bad*). Therefore, I also want to share the simple tools - developed by
me based on several other codes to serve as a general guideline to novice
programmers.
> Most of the codes are in Matlab and uses inbuilt functions - Hence, I am working
on a python version of these codes and will be uploding after testing. Please
feel free to contact me via [mail](subint@mtu.edu) - if you have any suggestions or corner cases.

Though I could have used a blogspot for the same purpose, I found the ads quite
distracting. Furthermore, I was inclined to learn about building and hosting
a website from scratch. The website in the current format is forked from

 [Moon Theme](https://taylantatli.github.io/Moon/)

 modified and hosted at

 [Github](https://github.com/)

you can learn more about the static website generated from
