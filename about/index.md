## Motivation
As a third year graduate student pursuing a PhD in Michigan Technological University,
I realized the importance of having a blog/website to share my thoughts with the world.
Though, I was inclined to use a website such as blogspot, I found the ads quite
distracting - also, this provided me an opportunity to learn a bit about building and
maintaining websites. Even then, the plans for the website was mostly conceptual and
not even  a single line of code was written. However, it was the submission of my first
journal paper and also the atmospheric turbulence course credited during the 2019 spring semester
that served as the impetus to kickstart the blog.

Browsing through the internet, I came across the blog of Walter Hannah, scientist at LLNL
and in the blog, he provided a brief description of his publications and his perspectives on
different climate models etc. Further, an insight into the mind of the author of a
publication is valuable to the general reader and I believe this blog can be a good platform for that.

Secondly, during the course of my PhD - I have realized, there are poorly written tools popping up as
the top Google search results for several problems related to fluid dynamics or rather basic statistics.
Hence, I had to struggle a lot to differentiate between good and bad code. (*Someone can bin my code can also as bad*)
Therefore, I also want to share the simple tools - developed by me based on several other codes to serve as a general
guideline to novice programmers.
> Most of the codes are in Matlab and uses inbuilt functions - Hence, I am working on a python version of these
codes and will be uploding after testing. Please feel free to contact me via mail - if you have any suggestions or
corner cases.
